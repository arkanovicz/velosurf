This Webapp example demonstrates:

 - the use of the localization filter (see javadoc for the velosurf.web.l10n.LocalizationFilter)

 - the use of the authentication filter (see javadoc for the velosurf.web.auth.AuthenticationFilter)

 - the use of the template name filter (see javadoc for the velosurf.util.TemplateNameFilter)

To install it:

1. Create an empty Webapp in your Servlet container.

2. Copy the content of the auth-l10n directory to your Webapp folder.

3. Copy the necessary libraries to WEB-INF/lib (Velosurf dependencies plus
   your JDBC driver lib should be a good first guess).

4. Adapt the database login informations in model.xml

Some remarks:

 - the provided deployment descriptor (web.xml) is for a 2.4 servlet container.

 - the empty index.html file at root is here to fool the servlet container in
   letting him find a welcome file whereas we will redirect the user later on
   to a localized welcome file.
