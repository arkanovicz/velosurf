This example show how to use Velosurf in the VPP Ant preprocessor.

To run it you need to have Ant installed and to be running an unix-like
shell (otherwise you'll have to adapt the provided script).

Just enter this directory and type "./demo.sh"

The script will:
 - download needed libraries from the net
 - launch "ant start-hsqldb" from the build directory of the release
   to start the hsqldb demo database server.
 - launch "ant demo" in this directory (the real part of the demo)
 - launch "ant stop-hsqldb" from the build directory of the release
   to stop the hsqldb demo database server.


Thanks to Mike Kienenberger for the initial version of this example.
