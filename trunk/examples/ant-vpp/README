This example show how to use Velosurf in the VPP Ant preprocessor.

To run it:

 - you need to have Ant installed

 - you need to have launched then "ant test" already once in the build
   directory of the release, so that needed libraries are downloaded
   from the net.

 - launch "ant start-hsqldb" from the build directory of the release
   to start the hsqldb demo database server.

 - if you are running a real operating system, run "./demo.sh" in this directory.
   Otherwise, you'll need to create the appropriate batch file.

 - launch "ant stop-hsqldb" from the build directory of the release
   to stop the hsqldb demo database server.
