2.3/3.0
 - document parametrized getters => 2.3
 - attribute/property precedence problem (example for myself: admin_lesson._cost in audiogo project) => 2.3
 - check that obfucated columns propagate automatically along foreign keys => 2.3
 - implement getMap() also for attributes? => 2.3
 - Instance should maybe reference a DBRef and not a DB (to control subclasses access) => 2.3
 - allow customization of LIMIT (like order and refinement) => 2.3
 - getMap peut marcher avec plus de 2 cols (keycol -> instance) => 2.3
 - map as an attribute result: "map/id:name", or "map/id:entityname" to have instances as values => 2.3
 - definition des requetes par contraintes, une contrainte etant une map => 2.3
  (ex 1 : si la map contient 'jour' alors le critere custom <jour/> between debut and fin doit s'appliquer)
  (ex 2 : si la map contient 'prenom' alors le critere automatique prenom=<prenom/> doit s'appliquer)
 => une espece de power refine sur les attributs
  <attribute><refinment mandatory=true|false [name=] col= />
puis $instance.attribute.refine(context...)
 - make attribute results implement List sans avoir besoin du row (seules les methodes size and co font rouler le rowset) => 2.3
 => resetable rowsets pour le cas de plusieurs #foreach
 - foreign keys referencing non-primary keys generate exceptions => 2.3
 - authenticator option for case sensivity => 2.3
 - add attribute result types: rowset/scalar, map, ... => 2.3
 - remember when an instance comes from newInstance (for the cache) => 2.3
 - an "upsert" method => 2.3
 - instance.insert should check obfuscation too! (cases where it doesn't? which ones?) => ??
 - review UserContext life cycle (threads/sessions) - is it thread-pooling resistant? => seems so.
 - when no pk defined, there should be an error message at reverse enginering time (why?) => ??
 - Entity & Attribute, as long as EntityReference and AttributeReference, must share a common ancestor (why?) => ??
 - strip tablename/field prefixes on demand (like "tab_") => 2.3
 - factorize Action and Attribute! => 2.3
 - msg "Ignoring second definition for attribute" should explicitely state that the ignored def is the implicit one
 - when result=row, attref should return null if not found
 - AttributeReference.toString() => null
 - How to forbid access to a getter or a setter in a mapped POJO class? Still don't know. => 2.3
 - Use separate classes for the different return types => 2.3
 - do sthing about serialization / transience (cf. tomcat sessions persistance for instance) => 2/3
 - warn on unused attributes in config file => not already done? I thought so...
 - "mangle" attribute to mangle table and/or field prefixes (but achievable using aliases) => 2.3
 - review extractColumnValues usage (how to choose to use source or destination column names, in regard to aliases) => seems ok
 - make foreign-key attribute optionnal (=> use natural join) => 2.3
 - optionnaly use foreign key names when reverse enginering => should be a database attribute, 2.3
 - kill the broken pipe mysql bug (occurs sometimes with mysql - rare but tedious)
   workaround: set a very long timeout in my.cnf : [mysqld] wait_timeout = 288000
 - implement caching also for root attributes => should be ok, check it
 - automatically propagate obfuscation along foreign keys => should be ok, check it
 - testcases for "parentkey.subkey" attributes parameters => plenty of testcases missing, anyway
 - testcases for multiple aliases => plenty of testcases missing, anyway
 - display build # in logs at startup => soon...
 - naming collisions detection for aliases => 2.3
 - TagCloudTool as an example => soon I hope...
 - Instances should check external POJOs for some additional methods, like "validate" => 2.3
 - RowIterator has to be splitted: one core object in sql (with more advanced accessors like InputStreams), one wrapper in context => 2.3
 - tool for one-shot messages in the session (like error messages that vanish once displayed) => 2.3 (or use macros)
 - configLoader should know FATAL error level, even if very unfrequent => 2.3
 - $db.error is not cleared - should it be ? => reconsider
 - review policy when column name clashes with attribute name: maybe add a RowIterator.internalGet called from ReadOnlyMap. => maybe
 - testcase for exported key => one day
 - when SQL exceptions are thrown from context objects, would it be possible to display line/col position in template? => 2.3
 - clarify user context scope and life cycle => very clear for a webapp (equals session)
 - put version and debugging options in build.properties => 2.3
 - validation filter: form values should be put as request attributes after the redirect! => 2.3
 - test cache reset => 2.3
 - testcase for aliasing => 2.3
 - testcases for POJO mapping => 2.3
 - testcase for localization => 2.3
 - use DatabaseMetaData.storeXXXCaseIdentifiers() to determine case sensivity => 2.3
 - a good dissertation about HTTP authentication to place somewhere http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=155252 => 2.3
 - l10n: provide flags => 2.3
 - obfuscation key should be specific to entities => 2.3
 - integration with a graphic reporting library => 2.3
 - docfix: a drivers.html page about DriverInfo => 2.3
 - allow the database connection to be configured via a jndi resource => 2.3
 - inheritance of entities in model.xml? => 2.3
 - ability to query current schema (ex : under Oracle :  select sys_context('userenv','current_schema') from dual) [done by caching the given schema for now] => 2.3
 - add EntityReference.insert(List(columns in natural order))? => 2.3
 - SQL enums? is there sthing to do to support them? => 2.3
 - id broker? => not really a job for Velosurf?
 - automatic reload when the configuration file is changed (but depends upon container!) => see feasibility
 - 'size' attribute on multivalued attributes? (approx JDBC size? exact size?) => 2.3 (workaround: .rows.size)
 - positionned updates and deletes (via UserContext) => maybe
 - paging via AbstractSearchTool? => 2.3
 - database metadata informations and operations => 2.3
 - allow setters by foreign-key (eg. $book.author = $author instead of $book.author_id = $author.id) ? => may be dangerous
 - XML databases access via IBM XML Data Mediator? => if needed one day
 - isolation levels
 - syntax coloring des fichiers XML/VTL dans la doc
