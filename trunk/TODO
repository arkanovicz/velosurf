TODO
----
 - doc: doc caching attribute
 - docfix: DBRef.get => AttrRef, Instance or *native type* (instead of string)
 - automatically propagate obfuscation along foreign keys
 - introspection of Instance subclasses for specific getters and setters (avoid loops!)
 - testcases for "parentkey.subkey" attributes parameters
 - testcases for multiple aliases
 - display build # in logs at startup
 - naming collisions detection for aliases
 - subkeys ("foo.bar"): httpquery tool policy (split or not) should be configurable
 - configloader doesn't allow old form instance constructors with (entity) as param
 - TagCloudTool
 - Instances should check external POJOs for some additional methods, like "validate"
 - facilitates acces to Database objects from Java
 - RowIterator has to be splitted: one core object in sql (with more advanced accessors like InputStreams), one wrapper in context
 - tool for one-shot messages
 - should newInstance(map) call validation?
 - reporting facility on errors => DBErrorListener or the like...
 - AttributeReference.delete() ? Or deleteRows() to avoid misuses
 - when/how is $db.error cleared?
 - review policy when column name clashes with attribute name: maybe add a RowIterator.internalGet called from ReadOnlyMap.
   Plus, RowIterator get javadoc is wrong for now.
 - testcase for exported key
 - when SQL exceptions are thrown from context objects, would it be possible to display line/col position in template?
 - clarify user context scope and life cycle
 - document newInstance(Map) and getLoggedUser
 - put version and debugging options in build.properties
 - validation: form values should be put as request attributes after the redirect!
 - docs: separate read-only methods and others
 - move auth, l10n and template name filter to an extension module (in the source tree & the docs)
 - test cache reset
 - change /** ... \n */ to /** ... */
 - parse conditions in refine and columns in order to apply aliases
 - review pools timeout
 - pool transaction statements
 - testcase for aliasing
 - testcases for POJO mapping
 - testcase for localization
 - review code for Logger.debug/trace strings calculation (avoid them!)
 - use DatabaseMetaData.storeXXXCaseIdentifiers() to determine case sensivity
 - a good dissertation about HTTP authentication to place somewhere http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=155252
 - l10n: flags
 - obfuscation should be specific to entities
 - graphic reporting
 - docfix: a drivers.html page about DriverInfo
 - allow the database connection to be configured via a jndi resource
 - inheritance of entities in velosurf.xml?
 - shared catalog: what to use as magic number?
 - ability to query current schema (ex : under Oracle :  select sys_context('userenv','current_schema') from dual) [done by caching the given schema for now]
 - add EntityReference.insert(List(columns in natural order))?
 - SQL enums?
 - id broker?
 - automatic reload when the configuration file is changed (but depends upon container!)
 - 'size' attribute on multivalued attributes? (approx JDBC size? exact size?)
 - positionned updates and deletes (via UserContext)
 - paging via AbstractSearchTool?
 - database metadata informations and operations
 - allow setters by foreign-key (eg. $book.author = $author instead of $book.author_id = $author.id) ?
 - XML databases access via IBM XML Data Mediator?
