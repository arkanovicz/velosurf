 - vpp example
 - a good disseration about HTTP authentication to place somewhere http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=155252
 - auth: logout
 - i18n: flags
 - obfuscation should be specific to entities
 - generalize ignorePrefix with a regex
 - update README => 2.0
 - a page about dependencies => 2.0
 - RowIterator.next() returns itself... really dirty... => 2.0
 - split build.xml into build,download,test... and move it in a build directory
 - prefetching?
 - graphic reporting => 2.0
 - docfix: a drivers.html page about DriverInfo
 - make a whole sourcecode review about members access (public/protected/private) => 2.0
 - docfix: add "seed" database attribute to config description => 2.0
 - docfix: split main mage => 2.0
 - docfix: add doc for constraints
 - docfix: replace DTD with an XML Schema definition (and move it to a separate page) => 2.0
 - docfix: remove anxiogen remarks full of acronyms like "easy VTL language" (or explain acronyms) => 2.0
 - allow the database connection to be configured via a jndi resource?
 - rewrite description: an extensive set of independant tools that provide automagic database mapping, 
     forms validation, authentication and internationalization to the velocity-tools architecture. => 2.0
Should be somehting like this :
Velosurf is a database access layer library for the Apache Velocity template engine. It provides an automagic database
mapping without any code generation.
In the context of a velocity-tools web application, Velosurf also provides handy tools for authentication, internationalization and forms validation.
 - flatten properties ? Person.address.street = person.AdressStreet? May be slow!
 - update class diagram
 - way of specifying a pair (entity/key parameter name) that will mark the corresponding cached entry as dirty
 - in case of an autoincrement unique id, could Instance.insert() set the new id value in itself ? Yes, if metadata knows about autoincrements.
 - generics for java interface (in a new package) - impossible without recompilation
 - descending order option for entities and multivalued attributes => 2.0
 - Spring integration => nothing to do but some doc => 2.0
 - inheritance of entities in velosurf.xml?
 - shared catalog: what to use as magic number?
 - correct the behaviour of the RowIterator : hasNext() has to be called only once by loop iteration... => 2.0
 - issue a warning if the query of an attribute does not have any reference to the entity row => 2.0
 - make HttpQueryTool inherit from ParameterParser => 2.0
 - reinforce some syntax constraints on the config file (ex : attribute without 'result' argument) => 2.0
 - ability to query current schema (ex : under Oracle :  select sys_context('userenv','current_schema') from dual)
 - add EntityReference.insert(List(columns in natural order))?
 - SQL enums?
 - doc : a page on relationships
 - automatic doc generation?
 - id broker?
 - automatic reload when the configuration file is changed (=> 2.0 - but depends upon container!)
 - 'size' attribute on multivalued attributes? (approx size? exact size?)
 - positionned updates and deletes (how?)
 - paging via AbstractSearchTool?
 - database metadata informations and operations
 - an easy way to associate columns to html form field types ? => VTL macros library
 - reverse engeenering of foreign keys, if used dbms allows it (but they must be aproprietely named explicitely in the SQL declaration!)
     name can be the name of the distant table for only one fk => 2.0
 - allow setters by foreign-key (eg. $book.author = $author instead of $book.author_id = $author.id) => 2.0
 - XML databases access via IBM XML Data Mediator?
 - inclusion mechanism for the config file => 2.0
 - autofetching via cookies (session attributes ?) => 2.0
