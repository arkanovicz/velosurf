TODO
----
 - review code for Logger.debug/trace strings calculation (avoid them!)
 - bug: hsqldb: when no schema specified, imported or exported keys reverse queries sometimes give the 'PUBLIC' schema => 2.0
 - bug: schema name is sometimes included in attribute name when reverse enginering imported/exported keys => 2.0
 - manual definition of imported and exported keys
 - use DatabaseMetaData.storeXXXCaseIdentifiers() to determine case sensivity
 - bug: read-only="true" and Archego managed to write to the database! (updates are blocked but inserts work) => 2.0
 - bug: if result="ROW/...", the attribute definition fails without any log and the attribute is not found (was a raw attribute... probably not important) => 2.0
 - parse order and refinement to avoid query injections => 2.0
 - vpp example (implies a Velosurf.setConfigFile)
 - a good dissertation about HTTP authentication to place somewhere http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=155252
 - i18n: flags
 - obfuscation should be specific to entities
 - generalize ignorePrefix with a regex
 - update README => 2.0
 - a page about dependencies => 2.0
 - prefetching?
 - graphic reporting => 2.0
 - docfix: a drivers.html page about DriverInfo
 - make a whole sourcecode review about members access (public/protected/private) => 2.0
 - docfix: add "seed" database attribute to config description => 2.0
 - allow the database connection to be configured via a jndi resource
 - rewrite description: an extensive set of independant tools that provide automagic database mapping, 
     forms validation, authentication and internationalization to the velocity-tools architecture. => 2.0
Should be somehting like this :
Velosurf is a database access layer library for the Apache Velocity template engine. It provides an automagic database
mapping without any code generation.
In the context of a velocity-tools web application, Velosurf also provides handy tools for authentication, internationalization and forms validation.
 - flatten properties ? Person.address.street = person.AdressStreet? May be very slow!
 - update class diagram
 - inheritance of entities in velosurf.xml?
 - shared catalog: what to use as magic number?
 - issue a warning if the query of an attribute does not have any reference to the entity row
 - ability to query current schema (ex : under Oracle :  select sys_context('userenv','current_schema') from dual) [done by caching the given schema for now]
 - add EntityReference.insert(List(columns in natural order))?
 - SQL enums?
 - doc : a page on relationships
 - id broker?
 - automatic reload when the configuration file is changed (but depends upon container!)
 - 'size' attribute on multivalued attributes? (approx JDBC size? exact size?)
 - positionned updates and deletes (via UserContext)
 - paging via AbstractSearchTool?
 - database metadata informations and operations
 - allow setters by foreign-key (eg. $book.author = $author instead of $book.author_id = $author.id) ?
 - XML databases access via IBM XML Data Mediator?
