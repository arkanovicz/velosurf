TODO
----
 - update class diagram
 - automatic loading of needed libraries in build.xml
 - way of specifying a pair (entity/key parameter name) that will mark the corresponding cached entry as dirty
 - in case of an autoincrement unique id, could Instance.insert() set the new id value in itself ? Yes, if metadata knows about autoincrements.
 - generics for java interface (in a new package)
 - the 'full' caching method is not really usable (unless it is possible to unload exactly one instance) - neither pratical nor clever... remove it! => caching=yes|no
 - descending order option for entities and multivalued attributes
 - Spring integration
 - inheritance of entities in velosurf.xml?
 - shared catalog: what to use as magic number?
 - correct the behaviour of the RowIterator : hasNext() has to be called only once by loop iteration...
 - issue a warning if the query of an attribute does not have any reference to the entity row
 - make HttpQueryTool inherit from ParameterParser
 - reinforce some syntax constraints on the config file (ex : attribute without 'result' argument)
 - ability to query current schema (ex : under Oracle :  select sys_context('userenv','current_schema') from dual)
 - add EntityReference.insert(List(columns in natural order))?
 - SQL enums?
 - doc : a page on relationships
 - automatic doc generation
 - id broker?
 - automatic reload when the configuration file is changed (=> 1.5 - but depends upon container!)
 - 'size' attribute on multivalued attributes?
 - positionned updates and deletes
 - paging via AbstractSearchTool
 - database metadata informations and operations
 - an easy way to associate columns to html form field types ? => VTL macros library
 - forms validation
 - reverse engeenering of foreign keys, if used dbms allows it (but they must be named explicitely in the SQL declaration, which is rarely the case!)
 - allow setters by foreign-key (eg. $book.author = $author instead of $book.author_id = $author.id) ?
 - XML databases access via IBM XML Data Mediator?
 - inclusion mechanism for the config file
 - autofetching via cookies => 1.5
