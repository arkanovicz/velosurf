			<H1>Velosurf FAQ</H1>
			<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>1. General Questions</B></FONT></P>
			<P><B>1.1 What is Velosurf?</B> Velosurf is a light and flexible
			Java library meant to expose a relational database to <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Jakarta
			Velocity</A> templates. Velosurf does an automatic reverse
			enginering of a database source and provides a default mapping
			that can then be extended and customized in many ways.</P>
			<P><B>1.2 How do I use it?</B> Velosurf provides the Velocity
			context with a <CODE>$db</CODE> tool object that is a starting
			point to access database tables and queries. An XML configuration
			file allows you to gather all SQL code in one place: Table columns
			and SQL queries are seen as standard properties from within the
			templates.</P>
			<P><B>1.3 How does it work? </B>At start, Velosurf reads the
			configuration file - that must at least contain database
			connection parameters - plus all SQL queries that define custom
			properties. Then it performs a reverse enginering of the database.
			Roughly speaking, tables and result sets are used as iterators in
			#foreach loops, and rows are seen as associative maps (that map a
			column / a query / a query field to their values).</P>
			<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>2. Installation and configuration</B></FONT></P>
			<P><B>2.1 How do I use Velosurf within my Webapp?</B> The easiest
			way is to use the VelocityViewServlet class (or a subclass),
			provided with the <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/index.html">velocity-tools</A>
			subproject: it provides a generic plugin mechanism enabling
			external tools to be automatically plugged into Velocity contexts,
			with scope considerations. Refer to the Installation page for
			more.</P>
			<P><B>2.2 How do I use Velosurf within my application?</B> First,
			you must ensure that Velosurf will find its config file, as
			explained <A HREF="api/velosurf/standalone/Velosurf.html">here</A>.
			Then you just have to put an instance of
			<CODE>velosurf.standalone.Velosurf</CODE> in the Velocity context.</P>
			<P><B>2.3 How do I use Velosurf with DVSL?</B> Check the DVSL doc
			on how to create a toolbox. Then, include the line
			&quot;<CODE>toolbox.tool.db=velosurf.standalone.Velosurf</CODE>&quot;
			in your toolbox.props file, and have Velosurf find its
			velosurf.xml configuration file, as explained <A HREF="api/velosurf/standalone/Velosurf.html">here</A>.</P>
			<P><B>2.4 How do I use Velosurf with Texen?</B> Put the line
			&quot;<CODE>context.objects.db=velosurf.standalone.Velosurf</CODE>&quot;
			in your <CODE>texen.properties</CODE> file, and have Velosurf find
			the velosurf.xml configuration file as explained <A HREF="api/velosurf/standalone/Velosurf.html">here</A>.</P>
			<P><B>2.5 How do I use Velosurf with Spring?</B> Just define a
			velocity-tools toollbox containing a velosurf.web.VelosurfTool
			tool, and integrate this toolbox into Spring (see
			<A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-velocity/VelocityAndSpringTips">VelocityAndSpringTips</A>).</P>
			<P><B>2.6 How do I use Velosurf within VPP?</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
			TODO</SPAN></P>
			<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>3. SQL Questions</B></FONT></P>
			<P><B>3.1&nbsp;What about primary and foreign keys?</B> Primary
			keys are reverse enginered and used by Velosurf in all the <CODE>fetch</CODE>
			methods. For now, foreign keys are not reverse enginered but they
			can easily be specified in the configuration file, so that they
			appear as properties. You can then traverse foreign keys back and
			forth using the dot operator.</P>
			<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>4. Velosurf and the MVC Design Pattern</B></FONT></P>
			<P><B>4.1&nbsp;What does MVC stand for?</B> In brief, MVC stands
			for Model-View-Controller. It is an architecture design pattern
			that states that applications should be structured in three
			distinct layers, the Model (what your application modelizes), the
			View (typically Velocity) and the Controller (typically an
			ActionServlet or the like).</P>
			<P><B>4.2&nbsp;Is Velosurf MVC-compliant?</B> Certainly! It
			implements the data model part , leaving you with the business
			logic part of the model. However, you must keep in mind that you
			should not modify data objects from within Velocity templates (you
			can use the Velosurf Java API or standard JDBC calls to achieve
			modifications, either from within your controller or from custom
			mapping classes).</P>
			<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>5. Troubleshooting</B></FONT></P>
			<P><B>5.1&nbsp;It doesn't work!</B> The first thing to do is to
			check the log. Chances are you'll find an exception and/or a
			message indicating the cause or the problem.</P>
			<P><B>5.2&nbsp;Velosurf connects to the database, but hangs right
			after, with no message.</B> Have you provided a schema name ?
			Under Oracle for instance, there are so many system tables
			(several thousands) that the reverse enginering can be very long.
			You can also choose the &quot;manual&quot; reverse enginering
			option so that only the entities listed in velosurf.xml are
			processed.</P>
