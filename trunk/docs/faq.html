<h2 align="left">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>1. General Questions</h3>
<p><b>1.1 What is Velosurf?</b> Velosurf is a light and flexible Java library meant to expose a relational
database to <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Jakarta Velocity</a> templates. Velosurf does an
automatic reverse enginering of a database source and provides a default mapping that can then be extended
and customized in many ways.</p>
<p><b>1.2 How do I use it?</b> Velosurf provides the Velocity context with a <code>$db</code> tool object
that is a starting point to access database tables and queries. An XML configuration file allows you
to gather all SQL code in one place: Table columns and SQL queries are seen as standard properties
from within the templates.</p>
<p><b>1.3 How does it work? </b>At start, Velosurf reads the configuration file - that must at least
contain database connection parameters - plus all SQL queries that define custom properties. Then it
performs a reverse enginering of the database. Roughly speaking, tables and result sets are used as
iterators in #foreach loops, and rows are seen as associative maps (that map a column / a query / a query
field to their values).</p>
<h3>2. Installation and configuration</h3>
<p><b>2.1 How do I use Velosurf within my Webapp?</b> All you need to do is to put an instance
of velosurf.web.VelosurfTool into your Velocity context. 
The easiest way is to use the VelocityViewServlet
class (or a subclass), provided with the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/index.html">velocity-tools</a>
subproject: it provides a generic plugin mechanism enabling external tools to be automatically plugged
into Velocity contexts, with scope considerations. Refer to the Installation page for more.</p>
<p><b>2.2 How do I use Velosurf within my Java application?</b> First, you must ensure that Velosurf will find
its config file, as explained <a href="api/velosurf/Velosurf.html">here</a>. Then you just have
to put an instance of <code>velosurf.Velosurf</code> in the Velocity context.</p>
<p><b>2.3 How do I use Velosurf with DVSL?</b> Check the DVSL doc on how to create a toolbox.
Then, include the line &quot;<code>toolbox.tool.db=velosurf.standalone.Velosurf</code>&quot; in your
toolbox.props file, and have Velosurf find its velosurf.xml configuration file (see 2.2).</p>
<p><b>2.4 How do I use Velosurf with Texen?</b> Put the line &quot;<code>context.objects.db=velosurf.standalone.Velosurf</code>&quot;
in your <code>texen.properties</code> file, and have Velosurf find the velosurf.xml configuration file (see 2.2).</p>
<p><b>2.4 How do I use Velosurf with Ant/VPP?</b> TODO</p>
<h3>3. SQL Questions</h3>
<p><b>3.1 What about primary and foreign keys?</b> Primary keys are reverse enginered and used by Velosurf
in all the <code>fetch</code> methods. TODO For now, foreign keys are not reverse enginered but they can
easily be specified in the configuration file, so that they appear as properties. You can then
traverse foreign keys back and forth using the dot operator.</p>
<h3>4. Velosurf and the MVC Design Pattern</h3>
<p><b>4.1&nbsp;What does MVC stand for?</b> In brief, MVC stands for Model-View-Controller.
It is an architecture design pattern that states that applications should be structured in three distinct
layers, the Model (what your application modelizes), the View (typically Velocity) and the Controller 
(typically an ActionServlet or the like).</p>
<p><b>4.2&nbsp;Is Velosurf MVC-compliant?</b> Certainly! It implements the data model part,
leaving you with the business logic part of the model. However, you must keep in mind that
you should not modify data objects from within Velocity templates (you can use the Velosurf
Java API or standard JDBC calls to achieve modifications, either from within your
controller or from custom mapping classes).</p>
<h3>5. Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><b>5.1&nbsp;It doesn't work!</b> The first thing to do is to check the log. Chances are you'll find
an exception and/or a message indicating the cause or the problem.</p>
<p><b>5.2&nbsp;Velosurf connects to the database, but hangs right after, with no message.</b>
Have you provided a schema name ? Under Oracle for instance, there are so many system tables
(several thousands) that the reverse enginering can be very long. You can also choose the
&quot;manual&quot; reverse enginering option so that for instance only the entities listed in velosurf.xml
are processed.</p>
