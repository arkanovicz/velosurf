<h1>What is Velosurf?</h1>

<div class="subsection">
<p align="left">Velosurf is a java database mapping layer
for&nbsp;<a href="http://velocity.apache.org">Apache
Velocity</a>.</p>

<p> Velosurf provides an 'out-of-the-box' automatized
mapping of database tables and fields, along with the ability to easily
define custom entities, queries and actions in SQL. It is a
lightweight placeholder to persistence systems.</p>

<p align="left">Velosurf main features are:</p>

<ul>

  <li>easy template grammar</li>

  <li>code isolation: SQL queries are gathered in one place and
appear as standard
objects properties</li>

  <li>dynamic mapping: no need to recompile on any database change</li>

  <li>automatic connection recovery, statements and connections
pooling</li>

  <li>reverse engeenering of database schema</li>

  <li>natural type mapping</li>

  <li>transactions</li>

  <li>default Java mapping objects that you can override when
needed</li>

  <li>basic tools to include authentication, internationalization
and data validation in your&nbsp;app</li>

</ul>

<p>Velosurf can be used as a standard Velocity tool (and as such
easily integrated in every Web framework that supports the Velocity
Tools rendering layer), as well as a generic java database abstraction
layer.</p>
</div>
<h1 align="left">Why Velosurf?</h1>
<div class="subsection">
<p align="left">The main goal of Velosurf is to spare
template writers the pain of rewriting specific database mapping layers
in Java for each project involving Velocity and database entities. It
is also meant to have a clean separation between SQL, Java and VTL.</p>

<p align="left">Persistence layers are hard to design and
maintain, and have been made obsolete by database caching technology.
So why not have a thin and generic mapping engine that will fetch
values directly from the database when you need them? With Velosurf,
object properties can represent not just column values, but also
complex queries, something difficult to do with a persistence framework.</p>

<p align="left">Last but not least: developers often try
to protect users from many concepts that may appear too complex or too
weird to them. But even if a data model is complex, its complexity has
nothing or little to do with technical constraints, and everything to
do with logic and modeling. The spirit of Velosurf is that those
constraints should be shared and exposed to all people involved in a
project - like designers - who should be as competent as developers are
(who said "more"?) to deal with business logic.</p>

<p align="left">In a nutshell, Velosurf allows developers
to expose a data model where properties are table fields or SQL queries
and designers to easily traverse this data model by means of the '.'
dereferencement operator (e.g. "<code>book.publisher.address</code>").</p>
